# Video Game Search App

There are hundreds of iconic video games that have taken the world by storm over the years. I want to build an app that derives from an API that similar to our movie app that will search and display lots of information on said games by simply searching their name.

### Technologies Used

- HTML 
- CSS
- Javascript
- Jquery

### Daily Plan

| Day | Goal |
|-----|------|
| 1 | Choose API and get it into my Javascript |
| 2 | Create base form of the app itself (will be busy this day) |
| 3 | Create the logic needed to link button presses and searches to the API |
| 4 | Extra day here incase things are worse than I was expecting and need extra time |
| 5 | Hoping for the most part it all works and everything is set in place from a functional aspect. I don't have an exact final vision of the app's look yet so I wanna take the rest of the days to make it look nice, and to make sure it works |
| 6 | Extra Day if needed
