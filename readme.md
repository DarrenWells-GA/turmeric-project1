# Video Game Search App

So originally I was gonna make a Video Game Search app that pulled from an API full of info on most popular games that exist, but I couldn't get the API to work properly. It wanted me to register to become like a Twitch Dev or something and I couldn't get it all to work. So inevitebly I swapped over to the Trivia Game backup due to time and IRL restrictions instead. I have decided to keep the original stuff here to show what my plan was gonna be until I messed it up. 

### Technologies Used

### Daily Plan

| Day | Goal |
|-----|------|
| 1 | Choose API and get it into my Javascript |
| 2 | Create base form of the app itself (will be busy this day) |
| 3 | Create the logic needed to link button presses and searches to the API |
| 4 | Extra day here incase things are worse than I was expecting and need extra time |
| 5 | Hoping for the most part it all works and everything is set in place from a functional aspect. I don't have an exact final vision of the app's look yet so I wanna take the rest of the days to make it look nice, and to make sure it works |
| 6 | Extra Day if needed
